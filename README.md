## Troubleshooting

### 1. Extension Doesn't Work on Certain Pages
- The extension cannot run on restricted pages like `chrome://` or `edge://`.
- A custom alert will notify you if the extension is unable to run on the current page.

### 2. Invalid Filename Error
- If the tab title contains invalid characters, the extension will sanitize the filename automatically.
- Example: `My Document: A Study?` â†’ `My_Document__A_Study_.md`

### 3. No Content Scraped
- Ensure you are selecting an element that contains visible content (e.g., text, images, or videos).
- Avoid selecting empty or non-content elements (e.g., `<div>` with no text).

## Customization

### Modify the Code
- Open the `content.js` file to customize:
  - **Markdown Formatting**: Update the `scrapeToMarkdown` function.
  - **Ignored Elements**: Modify the `shouldIgnoreElement` function to exclude specific tags, classes, or attributes.

### Add New Features
- Extend the functionality by adding support for additional HTML elements (e.g., tables, iframes).
